# Sentiment-Analysis-with-Word-Embeddings
A Sentiment Analysis model in keras to analyse toxic comments online . The Corpus is preprocessed using Glove Word Embeddings .

Data :

The Corpus used in the following code is taken from a Kaggle competetion "Toxic Comment Classification" . It consists of online 
comments from Wikipediaâ€™s talk page edits .The main task is to classify the comments into different categories such as toxic ,severe toxic ,obscene ,threat ,insult and identity hate .The link to the competetion : https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge (The competetion deadline was over before I started with Sentiment Analysis and thus couldn't submit my result)  



Word Embeddings :

The Corpus as we all know is raw text and thus needs to be preprocessed before feeding to our model . I used Glove pretrained Word Embeddings to form word vectors of the given raw data . The Word Vectors formed have 100 dimensions . i.e each word was been represented as a 100 dimensional vector .

Visualizing the Word Embeddings ( Unsupervised Learning Approach ):

We need to visualize our word embedding vectors before using them to see whether related words are positioned close to each other .
As our word vectors have 100 dimensions it is not easy to visualize them . Thus , I used an unsupervised approach (Dimensionality Reduction ) to reduce the dimensions to 2 and then plot these words . The algorithm used is t-SNE(Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding ) . As we have used pretrained weights we get very good results on visualizing the data . This approach is important when we train our own Embeddings .



Finally a Bidirectional LSTM model is built using keras to classify the sentences into appropriate categories .
